# Overview

Analyzes V and J gene segment usage frequencies in T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires, a key method for characterizing immune repertoire diversity and identifying biases in gene segment utilization. The block processes clonotype data from VDJ processing blocks (e.g., MiXCR Clonotyping) and calculates the frequency of each V and J gene segment across samples by aggregating clonotype abundances. This analysis helps reveal biases in gene usage that can be associated with antigen exposure, vaccination, disease states, or immune responses to specific pathogens.

The block generates comprehensive usage statistics for individual V genes, J genes, and V-J gene combinations, enabling comparison of gene segment frequencies across different samples or experimental conditions. Results are presented through interactive visualizations including heatmaps for V-J gene combinations and bar plots for individual V and J gene frequencies, facilitating identification of repertoire biases and their biological significance.
